# Sushi Bot
Sushi Bot is currently a work in progress.
The vision for Sushi Bot is a general purpose Discord bot for VTubers,
with a variety of commands and a chat experience system with an RPG.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js and npm
Sushi Bot is built on [Node.js v18 (Hydrogen)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.1/)
and therefore requires it to run. Select the appropriate installation
for your system and follow the setup instructions.

**For Windows users:** \
Get the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.1/node-v18.16.1-x64.msi)

**For macOS users:** \
Get the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.1/node-v18.16.1.pkg)

**For Linux users:** \
Refer to [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
and make sure to install Node v18

### Discord bot
The programme needs a Discord bot to connect to. You can make
a bot in Discord's [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
by creating a new application.

run your own instance of Sushi Bot if you wish to.
